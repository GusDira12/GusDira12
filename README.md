# About Me
hello o/ name's gus and this is where I just throw all the code I have and leave them as is.
it's mostly:
- java
- html/css
- js
- c/c++

I play games and I upload/stream them every 78 years or so:
- youtube: https://youtube.com/GusDira12/
- twitch: https://twitch.tv/GusDira12/

I am intentionally making everything here public, no bullshittery or anything. use them if you wish.
that's all pretty much, thanks for even reading all of this.
