# About Me
hello o/ name's gus and this is where I just throw all the code I have and leave them as is.

I take CS, and is currently venturing into the depths of java and c/c++, mostly because of application. I self-learn and I hate groups most of the time.
the languages I currently learn are (and not limited to):
- java (main language for uni)
- html/css (web stuff)
- js (another web stuff)
- c/c++ (mostly for competitive programming)

I play games and I upload/stream them every 78 years or so:
- youtube: https://youtube.com/GusDira12/ (only videos here, switching is still blank)
- twitch: https://twitch.tv/GusDira12/ (streams go here)

other things I'm interested in? here you go:
- music (drum mostly)
- photography (carrying a good ol' Canon 550D and a 55-250mm lens. yeah, it's old and I don't have the normal lens)
- anime (..duh. for now, you can see them here: https://myanimelist.com/profile/GusDira12)

I am intentionally making everything here public, no bullshittery or anything. use them if you wish.

that's all pretty much, thanks for even reading all of this.
