# [イントロデュース](https://github.com/GusDira12/GusDira12)
hello o/ this is where I throw all things from code to idk anything

the stuff I do atm are:
- java (app and stuff)
- python (same thing basically)
- html/css/js (web)
- c/c++ (occasional atm, used for apps)

I'll just put these here for reference but other cool stuff I'm into are:
- photography (pretty mild atm due to time and location but I'll try to post sometime somewhere idk)
- languages (from just regular language to programming, the ones I like I learn quite a bit, English Literature, Japanese, and C++ are the notables)
- music (mainly drums, currently waiting to get a kit for personal use)
- anime (uhh yeah? waiting for update but you can check this [outdated profile](https://myanimelist.net/profile/GusDira12) for now)

feel free to use everything in this account for your own goods

that's all pretty much, thanks for even reading all of this
